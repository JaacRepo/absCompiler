To build and install the Eclipse plugin, install the Eclipse Plug-in
Development Environment (PDE), then go into the eclipse-plugin/ subdirectory
and execute:

	ant -Declipse.home=<path to eclipse> build-all-plugins generate-update-site

Add the resulting local update site to Eclipse (Preferences -> Install/Update
-> Available Software Sites -> Add ...):

	file:<path prefix>/abstools/eclipse/eclipse-plugin/update-site

Note that the Apet and Costabs (SACO) plugins only run on Linux and will not
be installed on Mac or Windows machines.  They do, however, run on the Eclipse
installed in the Vagrant virtual machine.

Deploy remote update site (needs access to the server):

	ant -Declipse.home=<path to eclipse> deploy-update-site

                           Alternative method
================================================================================
Alternatively, the Eclipse plugin can be used by building and executing the
source code of the plug-in from within Eclipse itself. First start Eclipse, then:

Import the source code of the plug-in into Eclipse:
1a. File > Import... > Existing Projects into Workspace > Next
1b. Root directory: browse to the abstools folder (it should contain eclipse-plugin)
1c. Select only the following two projects (de-select the others), and click Finish:
   org.abs-models.abs.compiler
   org.abs-models.abs.plugin
   org.abs-models.sdedit

Build and run the plug-in
2a. In the Package Eclorer: left click the org.abs-models.abs.plugin project
2b. Run > Debug As > Eclipse Application

After waiting a couple of seconds, an internal Eclipse instance is launched.
Within that Eclipse instance, ABS projects can be used (after importing or
creation).
