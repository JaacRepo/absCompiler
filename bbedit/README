A simple Codeless Language Module for BBEdit and TextWrangler
=============================================================


The file `abs.plist` in this directory contains support for ABS for
the BBEdit and TextWrangler editors.  BBEdit and TextWrangler are
editors running on Mac OS X produced by BareBones Software.  See the
Codeless Language Module Reference at
http://www.barebones.com/support/develop/clm.html.

To activate ABS support, copy or symlink this file to the `Application
Support/BBEdit/Language Modules` resp. `Application
Support/TextWrangler/Language Modules` subdirectory of either your
`Library` or `Dropbox` folder, then restart the editor.
