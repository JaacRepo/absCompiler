          HOW TO USE THE TEX BIBLIOGRAPHY DATABASES IN HATS
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The instructions have been taken and derived from the MOBIUS bibli.bib file.


 0/ Please use only US-ASCII, 7-bit characters in editing this file.  Across
    the HATS project we have partners using different, incompatible, 8-bit
    encodings: any text that is not 7-bit clean will not survive the
    round-trip through everyones' text editors.

    Where accented characters are required in entries, use regular LaTeX
    commands like \"u or \t{oo}.  If these appear in authors' names, enclose
    them in a further set of parentheses so that BibTeX recognises them as a
    single letter: e.g., M{\"u}ller.

 1/ All the bibliography entries of the HATS project are kept in the
    TexInputs/bibli.bib file. If you want to use the file just make a
    symbolic link to the file from your local latex directory (often
    ~/texmf/bibtex/bib).

 2/ Other bib files in the HATS svn directory may be deleted unless HATS
    has warned not to do so (there must be good reason to keep a local file).

 3/ Identify HATS funded publications using the "keywords" field.  This
    should contain the word HATS and the relevant workpackage:

       (at)InProceedings{
       ...
           keywords = {HATS, wp3}
       ...}

    This HATS keyword is most important: it differentiates HATS project
    publications from others, and is used to generate the publication lists
    in our annual submissions to the EC and on the HATS website.

 4/ To avoid duplicate entries, each entry should use a standard key format:

    * the last name of the first author,
    * followed by the final initials of any co-authors,
    * the final two digit of the publication,
    * and finally "b", "c", ... to distinguish otherwise identical keys.

    Example:
        (at)InProceedings{AlbertAGP08c,
          author =    {E. Albert and P. Arenas and S. Genaim and G. Puebla},
          title =     {Dealing with Numeric Fields in Termination Analysis
                       of Java-like Languages},
          booktitle = {10th Workshop on Formal Techniques for Java-like
                       Programs},
          year =      2008,
          keywords =  {HATS, wp4}
        }

 5/ Enter author names in the form used by the authors themselves.  These do
    not need to follow any fixed format, as BibTeX will transform them
    according to the desired bibliography style.

 6/ There is a long list of (at)string abbreviations below for publishers,
    workshops, conferences and journals.  Please use them, and add new ones as
    required.  For papers at a conference or workshop, consider adding the
    proceedings volume separately and then referring to it through the
    crossref key.  There is already a list of conference proceedings at the
    end of this file.

 7/ If you find duplicate entries in the bibli.bib file, then in case of
           * identical keys: delete all duplicates
           * different keys: for the moment: inform the mailing list about
             the duplicate entry


 8/ Please keep entries sorted in the order of their keys, with
    crossreferenced proceedings (also sorted) at the end of the file.

    We describe an extension of ML with  records where inheritance is
    given  by ML   generic  polymorphism.  All common  operations  on
    records but  concatenation are supported,    in particular the  free
    extension of records.  Other  operations such as renaming  of fields
    are added.  The solution relies on an extension  of ML, where the
    language of types is sorted  and considered modulo equations, and on
    a record extension of types.  The solution is simple and modular and
    the type inference algorithm is efficient in practice.

               ML-like languages in particular, or simply in OCaml, whether they are programmers or language designers, beginners
         or knowledgeable readers —little pre-requiresite is actually assumed. They provide a formal description of the
         operational semantics (evaluation) and statics semantics (type checking) of core ML and of several extensions starting
         from small variations on the core language to end up with the OCaml language —one of the most popular incarnation of
         ML— including its object-oriented layer. The tight connection between theory and practice is a constant goal: formal
         definitions are often accompanied by OCaml programs: an interpreter for the operational semantics and an algorithm for
         type reconstruction are included. Conversely, some practical programming situations taken from modular or object-oriented
         programming patterns are considered, compared with one another, and explained in terms of type-checking problems. Many
         exercises with different level of difficulties are proposed all along the way, so that the reader can continuously
         checks his understanding and trains his skills manipulating the new concepts; soon, he will feel invited to select more
         advanced exercises and pursue the exploration deeper so as to reach a stage where he can be left on his own.},
