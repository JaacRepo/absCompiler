== Adding new language elements

=== Modify parser and AST

* modify `ABS.ast`: introduce new language elements
* modify `abs.g4`: decide on surface syntax
* add to `CreateJastAddASTListener.java`: create AST elements defined in `ABS.ast`

=== Add type checking

* modify type checker
** `typeCheck()`, `gettype()`
** make variable definitions visible to rest of program

=== Adapt backends

This applies to new language elements that are not rewritten into more basic forms

* modify each backend to generate the required code

=== Rewrite into more basic forms

* Introduce boolean flag to disable rewriting
* Only rewrite in core part of the language

  In deltas, traits: type information not available, other semantic
  constraints not met, ...

* Adapt pretty-printer, including `-nosugar` directive

* Never re-insert AST fragments, always copy

* Consider invalidating caches afterwards

=== Write test cases

=== Update manual


== Type Checking

=== Type Checking the SPL
* All source code files referenced here are under `/org.abs-models.abs.compiler/src/abs/frontend/delta`, unless otherwise noted.

The SPL type checker is invoked by calling `typecheckPL()` on the `Model` AST node. 
This top level method is defined by a JastAdd attribute in `ProductLineTypeAnalysis.jadd`, which delegates to `ProductLineTypeAnalysisHelper.typeCheckPL(..);`

.FIXME 
****
The SPL type checker should be called before flattening a product, but after running the old SPL sanity checks (such as checking for duplicate definitions, unused deltas etc.). Currently, the old checks are part of the product-specific type checker so they are run after flattening.
****

The helper method does the following:

* Check the SPL for strong unambiguity. This enables us to use any one valid delta order to assemble the SPL products.

* Build a trie data structure whose nodes represent all program variations by applying deltas to the core program _type abstraction_.

==== The Program Type Abstraction
Implemented in `ProgramTypeAbstraction.java`.

A program type abstraction (TA) records the program elements of core ABS as simple names (strings):
* Classes
** Fields
** Methods
* Functions (TODO)
* ADTs (TODO)
* etc. (TODO)

A delta can be applied to a TA `ta` by calling `ta.applyDelta(DeltaDecl d)`. This modifies the TA as described by the delta (by adding/removing/modifying elements). In case the delta cannot be applied (due to unfullfilled requirements -- e.g. adding a method to a class that does not exists), a type error is added to the TA's `SemanticConditionList`.

In addition, a TA keeps track of the SPL products that it represents. A TA will typically represent either no product or one particular product of the SPL. However, there can be several identical products in an SPL, which are thus represented by the same TA. The products are stored in `Set<ImplicitProduct> products`.

==== The Delta Trie
The _Product Family Generation Trie (PFGT)_ is built by `ProductLineTypeAnalysisHelper.buildPFGT(..)`. Essentially, for each valid feature combination defined by the feature model (i.e. the products of the SPL -- represented as `ImplicitProduct` AST nodes), a type abstraction is built and stored in a trie data structure.
