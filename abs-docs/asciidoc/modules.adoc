== Modules

All ABS definitions (classes, interfaces, functions data types, type aliases)
are contained in modules.  All definitions are visible in their own module
only, except when the module exports the name and it is imported in another
module or referenced by its qualified name.

NOTE: The `export` clause in a module definition exports _names_, not
definitions as such.  This means that if a module defines a class and an
interface with the same name, both definitions will be accessible if that name
is contained in the `export` clause.

.Syntax
|====
| _ModuleDecl_  ::= | `module` _TypeIdentifier_ `;` { _Export_ } { _Import_ } { _Decl_ } [ _Block_ ]
| _Export_      ::= | `export` _IdentifierList_ [ `from` _TypeIdentifier_ ] `;`
|              | {vbar} `export` `\*` [ `from` _TypeIdentifier_ ] `;`
| _Import_      ::= | `import` _IdentifierList_ [ `from` _TypeIdentifier_ ] `;`
|              | {vbar} `import` `*` `from` _TypeIdentifier_ `;`
| _IdentifierList_ ::= | _AnyIdentifier_ { `,` _AnyIdentifier_ }
| _AnyIdentifier_ ::= | _Identifier_ {vbar} _TypeIdentifier_

| _Decl_        ::= | _FunDecl_ {vbar} _TypeSynDecl_ {vbar} _DataTypeDecl_ {vbar} _ExceptionDecl_ {vbar} _InterfaceDecl_ {vbar} _ClassDecl_ {vbar} _TraitDecl_
|====

A module name is a type name and must always start with an upper case letter.

Every module starts with a declaration of the form

    module MyModule;

This declaration starts a new module named `MyModule`.  All declarations after
this line until the next module declaration belong to the module `MyModule`.

NOTE: The module `ABS.StdLib` contains the standard library and is
automatically imported by every module.  There is no need for an explicit
`import * from ABS.StdLib;` clause.


=== Exporting Identifiers

By default, modules do not export any names.  In order to make names defined
within a module available to other modules, the names have to be _exported_.
For example, to export a data type and a data constructor, one can write
something like this:

[source]
.Example
----
module Drinks;
export Drink, pourMilk, pourWater;
data Drink = Milk | Water;
def Drink pourMilk() = Milk;
def Drink pourWater() = Water;
----

Note that in this example, the data constructors are not exported, and other
modules can only create values of type `Drink` by calling the exported
constructor functions `pourMilk` and `pourWater`.  By only exporting the data
type without any of its constructors, one can realize _abstract data types_
in ABS.

A special export clause `export *;` exports all names that are defined in the
module.  Note that imported names are _not_ re-exported by `export *;` (but
can be re-exported via `export * from OtherModule;` clauses).

[source]
.Example
----
module Test;
export *;
export * from OtherModule;
import * from OtherModule;
----

=== Importing Identifiers

In order to use exported names of a module in another module, the names have
to be imported.  In a module definition, a list of import clauses follows the
list of export clauses.  After being imported, these names are accessible in
the current module.

Names can be accessible either qualified (with package prefix) or unqualified,
depending on how they are imported.


The following example makes the `Drink` data type of the module `Drinks`
accessible as `Drinks.Drink`:

[source]
.Example
----
module Bar;
import Drinks.Drink; <1>
import pourMilk from Drinks; <2>
----
<1> The name `Drink` is accessible in module `Bar` as `Drinks.Drink`.
<2> The name `pourMilk` is accessible in module `Bar` both as `Drinks.pourMilk` and `pourMilk`.


The `import * from Module;` statement makes all names that are exported from
module `Module` accessible without module qualifier in the current module.

[source]
.Example
----
module Bar;
import * from Drinks; <1>
----
<1> All names from `Drinks` are accessible in `Bar` with and without the `Drinks.` prefix.


==== Re-exporting Imported Names

It is possible to re-export names that are imported from another module. For example,

[source]
.Example
----
module Bar;
export * from Drinks;
import * from Drinks;
----

re-exports from `Bar` all names that are exported by module `Drinks`.  Another
module that writes `import * from Bar;` will have the names from `Drinks`
accessible as well.

To re-export only selected names, include only these names in the export list:

[source]
.Example
----
module Bar;
export Drink; <1>
import * from Drinks;
----
Only `Drink` is exported from `Bar`.



Note that only names that have been imported can be re-exported.  For example:

[source]
----
module Bar;
export * from Drinks;
import Drink from Drinks;
----

only re-exports `Drink`, as this is the only name imported from module
`Drinks`.
