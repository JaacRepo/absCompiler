== User-Defined Schedulers

User-defined schedulers are an experimental feature of Timed ABS.  They are
available on the Maude and Erlang backends.  This section describes the
current state of the implementation on the Erlang backend.

All identifiers introduced in this section reside in the `ABS.Scheduler`
module, which is not imported by default.


=== Defining Schedulers

A scheduler is a function that takes a list of processes and chooses one of
them.  Schedulers are ordinary ABS functions.

The following two example schedulers illustrate the concept.  The first,
deterministic scheduler takes the first process off the list; the second
scheduler chooses a non-deterministic one.

.Example
----
def Process defaultscheduler(List<Process> queue) = head(queue);

def Process randomscheduler(List<Process> queue) = nth(queue, random(length(queue)));
----

All schedulers must have a result type `Process` and must take an argument of
type `List<Process>` as their first argument.

NOTE: Schedulers can have more than one argument; arguments after the first
one will be filled with the value of object fields at scheduling time.  This
feature is available in the Maude backend only but will be implemented in the
Erlang backend as well.

=== Processes and Process Attributes

A _process_ is an ABS abstract datatype; i.e., there is no constructor
available to create a `Process` value inside ABS.  Processes are created by
the runtime and handed to schedulers.

Processes have _attributes_ which can be used by schedulers to choose the next
process to run.  For example, a scheduler could always prefer processes that
run a certain method.  The following attributes are available:

[options="header"]
|=======================
|Name |Type |Meaning
|`method` |`String` |Name of the method executed by the process
|`arrival` |`Time` |Time when method call was issued
|=======================

NOTE: The attributes `cost`, `procDeadline`, `start`, `crit` are available in
the Maude backend only but will be implemented in the Erlang backend as well.
The attributes `value`, `finish` are under consideration since their
usefulness is questionable.
// Duration cost(Process p) = builtin;
// Duration procDeadline(Process p) = builtin;
// Time start(Process p) = builtin;
// Time finish(Process p) = builtin;
// Bool crit(Process p) = builtin;
// Int value(Process p) = builtin;

=== Using Schedulers

Schedulers apply to _cogs_ since cogs are responsible for scheduling one of
their processes when idle.  Since cogs are created via `new` expressions, a
scheduler can be given at that point via an annotation.  Classes can have a
_default scheduler_ that is given as an annotation to the class definition;
any cog created when instantiating this class will have that scheduler by
default (unless overridden by an annotation at the `new` expression).

The following example shows how to define a class that uses the
`randomscheduler` by default.  The first argument (the list of processes) must
have the name `queue`.

[source]
.Example
----
[Scheduler: defaultscheduler(queue)] class C implements I {
  ...
}
----

The following example shows how to create a cog with a different scheduler.

[source]
.Example
----
   [Scheduler: randomscheduler(queue)] I instance = new C();
